## About
In this version of the **Pong Game** you can practice a single player Pong Game by hitting the ball against 3 of the 4 walls and making sure it doesn't hit the 4th wall that you are defending. 

The game was built using Python's **Turtle Library**, and it allows you to keep track of your Score and High Score. Practice hard in this version to beat your opponents in a 2 player Pong Game.
